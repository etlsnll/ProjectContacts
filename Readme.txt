This project uses the localDb names ProjectContacts.  It uses EF core migrations to create the tables, and a seeding class to populate some sample test data.

The REST Web Api is also build with .NET Core.

Logging uses NLog - log files location is: c:\temp\ProjectContactsLogs\

General description of functionality is on the home page:
\ProjectContacts\ClientApp\app\components\home\home.component.html



Apologies in advance - probably not enough comments - ran out of time to tidy this all up!
Hopefully the code is readable enough despite this.
